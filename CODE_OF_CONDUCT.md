# Swift Stream Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The Swift Stream project is committed to creating an open, respectful, and productive environment where contributors feel welcomed and encouraged to share ideas. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior and our response to unacceptable actions.

## Our Standards

To maintain a positive environment for all contributors, we expect the following behaviors:

- **Respect for Others**: Be considerate and respectful in all communications and interactions. Approach disagreements with openness and avoid personal attacks or inflammatory comments.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Offer feedback in a constructive, respectful way. Be open to receiving feedback and use it as an opportunity to improve.
- **Supportive Collaboration**: Work collaboratively and recognize the contributions of others. When giving credit or sharing achievements, ensure that everyone involved is acknowledged.
- **Integrity and Accountability**: Take responsibility for your actions. If a mistake is made, acknowledge it openly and take steps to correct it.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- **Harassment or Discrimination**: No form of harassment, bullying, or discriminatory remarks will be tolerated. This includes offensive comments or behavior related to race, religion, nationality, gender, or personal beliefs.
- **Aggressive or Disruptive Behavior**: Excessive arguing, hostility, or actions that disrupt the project’s collaborative spirit.
- **Sharing Private Information**: Respect privacy by not sharing others’ personal information (e.g., email, address) without permission.
- **Unprofessional Conduct**: Any conduct that could be reasonably interpreted as unprofessional, offensive, or inappropriate in a collaborative project setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Swift Stream spaces, including project repositories, issue tracking, pull requests, discussions, and other communications. It also applies when representing Swift Stream in public spaces, such as at events or in online forums.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers at [YOUR EMAIL HERE]. All reports will be handled confidentially, and we are committed to addressing them promptly.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. Actions in response to a violation may include a warning, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the project community, depending on the severity and frequency of the misconduct.

## Final Note
