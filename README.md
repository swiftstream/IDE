# Swift Stream

**Swift Stream** is a powerful IDE for VS Code that enhances your ability to work with Swift projects beyond the traditional iOS/macOS ecosystem.

## 🐳 Containerized Swift Development

It gives you the ability to write Swift code for **multiple streams** on **any platform**, all inside a Docker container!

The extension provides a convenient environment packed with features that together deliver an incredible development experience.

## 🌊 Choose Your Stream

- **Web**: Progressive web apps using WebAssembly
- **Server**: Backend apps using Vapor and Hummingbird
- **Embedded**: ESP32-C6, Raspberry Pi Pico, STM32, nrf52
- **Pure**: Libraries, macros, CLI tools, etc.

Projects for any of these streams can be easily created via the **"Start New Project"** wizard:

## ⌛️ Coming Soon (WIP)

- **Android**: Apps and libraries via JNI

## 📱 iOS, macOS, etc.

For **iOS**, **macOS**, and other Apple platforms, you still need to use **Xcode**.

## 🖥️ Where Does It Work?

Literally anywhere VS Code is available!

On Windows, Linux, and macOS, you'll have the **same experience** since your code and tools always run inside the same containerized environment — powered by Docker + DevContainer or via SSH tunnel.

## 💁‍♂️ Why Choose Containerized Development?

- Keeps your machine clean — no more toolchain and CLI-tools mess  
- Even very old projects will still compile, since they retain the original environment  
- You can deploy binaries compiled inside the container immediately  
- Easily switch between toolchains with one click  
- Work on a slow device by tunneling into a more powerful machine or server via SSH

## 🌷 Main Goals

- Stay developer-friendly  
- Let Swift newcomers start playing right away  
- Provide as many useful tools, conveniences, and features as possible

## 🧰 Functionality

First of all, you can easily create new Swift projects in an isolated, well-prepared environment.

Each stream provides a thoughtfully designed project interface, crafted with love to make maintaining your Swift project a joy.

## 💎 Features Collection

Enhance your development experience in each stream by installing powerful features with just one click!
